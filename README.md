## CrazyHealthStats.com 

#### What:
A collection of countries and their respective obesity populations, obesity growth rates, and direct economic impacts of obesity. Also a collection of line charts for current depression numbers as well as depression projections and obesity growth rates. 


#### Why:
The data is disparate and stored in several different PDFs across dozens of sites, and I wanted to make it easy to understand for everyone. 

This started as a research project for my startup, Map. People use Map to accomplish their goals faster.

Map provides a set of health and productivity tools along with a handful of agents that that are super helpful.

#### Open Source:
If you want to contribute, please open a PR. If you come across any bugs, obviously log one. The goal of this site was to better visualize the current state of our health. It's not easy to digest just exactly how mammoth this problem is.
